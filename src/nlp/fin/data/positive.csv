Londoners Could Elect City's First Muslim Mayor: London may elect it's first Muslim mayor
@abcnews @SadiqKhan makes sense. Muslims there are basically the majority anyway. The only white in London are tourists these days.

Not a Labour supporter at all but Sadiq Khan 's mayoral campaign has been well done. He speaks really well. Big job ahead.
Let's hope that Sadiq Khan and the many other Labour candidates standing for election tomorrow are not harmed by the events of the last week
I will be voting for @SadiqKhan today. I hope that the majority of Londoners will do the same. Our great city deserves a @UKLabour Mayor.
