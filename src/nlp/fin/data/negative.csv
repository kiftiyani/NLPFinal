it's important to be balanced and remind your readers that Gani is actually a Conservative supporter?
@johnprescott @bryanadams @SadiqKhan and I thought you were against extremists
Why I'm voting for @SadiqKhan 3. He gets the big issues facing LDN: appalling transport and a housing shortage; and has plan to tackle them.
@MaajidNawaz @WSJ @SohrabAhmari is @SadiqKhan Islamist? What does he believe is proper relationship btwn religion & government? @QuilliamF
I don't understand why working class minorities are debating whether or not to vote for Sadiq Khan
Do not vote for Sadiq Khan
@DaveWMac @JoannieCo @SadiqKhan nobody who's religion comes first before the job they intend to take should be in a position of power .
@Wassif_rehman cuz i dont like sadiq khan lol and cool ur not allowed to vote now or i will have to too
@niallboylan4fm Katie Hopkins vows to streak naked 'with sausage up bum' if Sadiq Khan becomes mayor ... will you be getting her on Boyler
@MaajidNawaz @WSJ @SohrabAhmari @SadiqKhan @QuilliamF exactly my point #notmuslimenough https:// twitter.com/carlkhoueiri/s tatus/727968785106411520 É??
@Muqadaam @SadiqKhan @georgegalloway then Khan should be DEFEATED!
You can watch the self styled unbiased James O'Brien;) give @SadiqKhan the easy ride he asked for
London the new Molenbeek? 7/7 victims let down ? Can Mayor Sadiq Khan handle Gov't without an Islamophobia impasse? http://www. telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ conservative/12179596/Sadiq-Khan-is-unfit-to-be-London-Mayor-Tory-cabinet-minister-says-in-heated-attack.html É??
@prodnose @SadiqKhan agree with your point Dan but have you taken a bus/tube recently? Cockney accent is a novelty in London now.
@SadiqKhan Tomorrow's election is crucial. Don't vote for Sadiq Khan !
"If @SadiqKhan takes 1000s from property developers"" where does that leave working class voters? @Aminaminky https://www. acast.com/littleatoms/lo ndonelectionspecial-2-youth-diversityandequality É??"""
@MaajidNawaz it may have to be with your method. Sadiq Khan may prove more relevant in reforming Muslims.
@ahmedgokal @SadiqKhan Did he really make anti-hijab comments? Forgive my ignorance.
#AskBoris Will you be giving Sadiq Khan the @MayorofLondon Twitter account? BTW I might move back to London now you are sodding off
For the avoidance of doubt
@ahmedgokal @SadiqKhan Strategic voting? Lesser of two evils?
@ahmedgokal @SadiqKhan I would be grateful if you attempt to convince me. I've been out of the political sphere for a while.
@THIRDTIMETRYING @MaajidNawaz @SadiqKhan what drama queen
@LondonrsOnBikes @sianberry .Don't vote for Sadiq Khan . He should not be Mayor of London. Huge risks involved.
"@GanatraNitin @SadiqKhan #Islamabad = death #islam = violence #islam = intolerance islam is a backwards religion practiced by savages!"""
He is not perfect
@AmyMek @SadiqKhan London must be a shithole of a town - or it soon will be if you get to be Mayor...
shit london 
Don't vote for him
@GuidoFawkes @SadiqKhan If the term É??Uncle TomÉ?ù is used by black people against other black people how is it É??racistÉ?ù? It is NOT racist.
@prodnose @SadiqKhan Christ fucking awful election ad
@SadiqKhan @ChukaUmunna @wesstreeting @eddieizzard @OwenJones84 But will you crack down on the islamo fascist parasites?
@SadiqKhan how can u be mayor of all London when you're a Moozie? Why dont u run for mayor of Pakistan or some other backwards #muslim place
@prodnose How can anyone have confidence in @SadiqKhan after his U-turn on #gardenbridge ? He's now in favour of this monument to corruption.
@tom_watson @ivanwhite48 @SadiqKhan I'm yet to see any honest representation from you. You are a big disappointment. #SligYourHook old boy.
@AmyMek @ArRuple @SadiqKhan He could only be elected if large segments of white Brits are virulent anti-Semites. It is so.
The irony of Sadiq Khan saying moderate Muslims are Uncle Toms and yet wanting now to be a big chief Uncle Tom himself.
@MaajidNawaz @lbc .For goodness sake don't lets have Sadiq Khan as the new Mayor of London!
@SadiqKhan you fucking dirty inbred pagan paedophile lover
@prodnose @SadiqKhan oh dear Danny oh dear. Let's not vote for regression please
@prodnose @SadiqKhan you don't sound convinced on your choice
@MikeGapes @SadiqKhan @IvanaBartoletti We were expecting tweets between the doorsteps!
@GracieSamuels @moethemyth @David_Cameron @SadiqKhan Please get a dictionary and learn what racism mean.
Poor @SadiqKhan . @EdMiliband_MP has just endorsed him. And it was all going so well. #LondonMayor2016
Dont know if I can class sadiq khan as a blairite but I certainly think hes in the bitterite posse
I will be supporting #JeremyCorbyn tommorow
@RealiteeBytz @SadiqKhan @MurtazaGeoNews What planet are you living on. IK's man is his brother in law who is attacking Islam everyday.
I am a Labour member but @SadiqKhan 's attitude towards Jeremy has put me off. Tomorrow I am voting for @sianberry second vote for Khan
@SadiqKhan Need a lighting director on the closing tracking shot.
@JamesPurefoy @SadiqKhan but he's also a racist

@WelshGasDoc @campbellclaret I'd marry @ZacGoldsmith as we could have a Bollywood themed wedding
@ZacGoldsmith Of course we spend too much money commuting...that's thanks to having a Tory mayor. Labour had Fares Fair. Boris put them up.
